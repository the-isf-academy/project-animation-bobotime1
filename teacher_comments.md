# Teacher Comments

Fantastic job with this project, Angus! You nailed the apple and it looks awesome. 

## Practices
### Planning 1/3
- In your planning document, each section was only partially filled out
- Going forward, be sure to fully answer each prompt and carefully think through your action steps

### Iterative development 3/3
- Great job mastering Github! 
- You committed 9 times, each with a descriptive message

### Testing 2/3
- Be sure to fully test your code before final submission. As you caught, your project.py file did not work immediately due to unindented code.
- Great testing strategy as described in your self-assessment. In addition to taking lines out, consider using print statements to determine if your code is doing as you intend. 

### Readability 3/3
- Super detailed comments in your functions and a fantastic README.md file

## Concepts
## Abstraction 2/3
- Overall, good use of parameters with the `size` in your apple and knife function. I would have like to see a size factor setting as your functions were perfectly set up to utilize it. 
- Great use of conditional statements with `elif i in range(41,71)`

## Decomposition 2/3
- Great work breaking down your drawing into separate functions
- You have a ton of custom functions, but only 2 custom modules. I would have liked to see those functions broke down into separate modules with accurate file names.
